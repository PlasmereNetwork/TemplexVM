# Templex `~/bin` Folder

All of these files must be place in your `/username/home/` directory.

## Steps for installation:
1. Download `Templex-master.zip` folder.
2. Unzip.
3. Move files to you `/<username>/home/` directory.
4. Move the `Templex-master/bin` folder to `/<username>/home/`.
5. Use `chmod 777 *` in the `/<username>/home/bin` folder for SSH.
    * If not using SSH, just make all files in the `/<username>/home/bin` folder executable (in bash).

It's that easy.
